;The BSP reserves 256 bytes at the top of reported RAM for Multi-ICE use.
;arm9RestartCodeAddress requires 40 or 128 bytes of destructable RAM
;depending on where you look it up, so give it all of the reserved 256 bytes.
;safeNonVectorAddress requires 64KB of read-only RAM not overlapping 
;the vector table that will not cause adverse effects to any hardware
;when it is read (such as buffers used for hardware would), so 
;give it RAM from the top as reported by sysPhysMemTop() (VxWorks' stack area)
;where we are reasonably confident that there isn't any used for hardware 
;buffers.

;The amount of RAM is limited to 32MB when reported to 
;VxWorks by the sysPhysMemTop() function or something below it. Thus the 
;amount of RAM in the IRD may be larger than 32MB. This is the case for all 
;Wabash IRD's which have 64MB of RAM that is limited to 32MB.
;Klondike IRD's have varying amounts of RAM. Thus, we assume 16MB here and 
;base memSize, arm9RestartCodeAddress, and safeNonVectorAddress from this. 

;If the IRD has a different amount of RAM, then these values should be changed
;to be based on the amount of RAM. memSize, arm9RestartCodeAddress and 
;safeNonVectorAddress are based below on the amount of RAM returned by
;sysPhysMemTop() (limited to 32MB). However, it may be possible (not tried)
;to use all of RAM (not limited) for these variables.
